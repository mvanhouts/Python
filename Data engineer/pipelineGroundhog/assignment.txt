Certainly! Here's a beginner exercise for building a data pipeline that involves ingesting data from a CSV file, transforming it, and storing it in a database.

Exercise: Building a Data Pipeline

    Data Ingestion:
        Download a sample CSV file containing some data (e.g., from a public dataset or create your own).
        Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
        Display the first few rows of the DataFrame to inspect the data.

    Data Transformation:
        Perform some basic data transformations on the DataFrame (e.g., renaming columns, filtering rows, converting data types, etc.).
        Ensure that the transformed DataFrame is in the desired format for storing in the database.

    Data Storage:
        Set up a local database (e.g., SQLite) or use an existing database.
        Establish a connection to the database.
        Create a table in the database that matches the structure of the transformed DataFrame.
        Store the transformed data from the DataFrame into the database table.

    Data Retrieval and Validation:
        Retrieve the stored data from the database table.
        Perform some basic validation checks to ensure the data was stored correctly (e.g., compare row counts, sample data, etc.).
        Print a success message if the validation checks pass.

Remember, this exercise is designed to help you get hands-on experience building a basic data pipeline. Feel free to adapt and modify the exercise based on your interests and learning goals.
