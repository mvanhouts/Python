Exercise: Data Transformation and Aggregation

You have been given a dataset in CSV format containing information about sales transactions. The dataset includes the following columns: transaction_id, product_id, customer_id, quantity, and timestamp. Your task is to perform data transformation and aggregation operations on this dataset to derive some meaningful insights.

Here are the steps to follow:

    Load the CSV data into a pandas DataFrame.
    Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps. This may include handling missing values, converting data types, or removing outliers.
    Analyze the data to answer the following questions:
    a. What is the total quantity sold for each product?
    b. How many unique customers made purchases?
    c. What is the total sales revenue for each product?
    d. What is the total sales revenue for each day?
    Aggregate the data and store the results in a new DataFrame.
    Save the aggregated data to a new CSV file or load it into an SQL database using sqlAlchemy.
